# Smart-Security-System-based-on-intrusion-and-anomaly-Detection
Design and implement a smart security system that utilizes machine learning models for
facial and weapon detection. The system should accurately detect and classify potential
threats in real time, ensuring smooth operation and enhanced security. By automating
these processes, we aim to improve efficiency and safety while minimizing false alarms.
The system should be adaptable to different environments and capable of monitoring
multiple areas simultaneously.
